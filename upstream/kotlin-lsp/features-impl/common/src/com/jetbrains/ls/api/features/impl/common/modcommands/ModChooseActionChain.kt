/**
 * Represents a chain of [ModCommandAction]s produced by [ModChooseAction]s.
 * In a trivial case consists of a single non-choice action.
 *
 * [steps] represents a chain of choices which results in [leaf].
 *
 * The overall order of steps looks like this:
 * - `step.first()`
 * - ...
 * - `step.last()`
 * - `leaf`
 *
 * [steps] can be empty, in that case [leaf] simply represents a single non-choice action.
 *
 * To unfold a [ModCommandAction] into a list of [ModCommandAction], see [flattenChoiceActions].
 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * Q: Why this class and [flattenChoiceActions] are even needed? Can't we simply add a new
 * [com.jetbrains.ls.kotlinLsp.requests.core.ModCommandData] subtype?
 *
 * A: We have to resort to expanding [ModChooseAction] into flattened [ModChooseActionChain] because
 * it's currently impossible to natively express [ModChooseAction] with [com.jetbrains.ls.kotlinLsp.requests.core.ModCommandData]
 * and current version of LSP protocol. We can probably get back to this question in the future,
 * when https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/994 or similar capabilities
 * are provided.

/**
 * Takes a [ModCommandAction] and recursively expands all [ModChooseAction] nodes into a list of [ModChooseActionChain]s.
 *
 * Each resulting [ModChooseActionChain] represents one possible path from this action to a terminal (non-choice) command.
 * If this action is not a [ModChooseAction], returns a list with a single [ModChooseActionChain] with empty [ModChooseActionChain.steps].
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * Action1 (ModChooseAction)
 *   ├─ Action2 (terminal)
 *   └─ Action3 (ModChooseAction)
 *        ├─ Action4 (terminal)
 *        └─ Action5 (terminal)
 * ```
 * Would produce 3 chains:
 * ```
 * - [Action1] -> Action2
 * - [Action1, Action3] -> Action4
 * - [Action1, Action3] -> Action5
 * ```
 *
 * Note 1: To properly recognize and expand [ModChooseAction]s, all of the [ModCommandAction]s in the chains are performed on the passed [context].
 *
 * Note 2: Only top-level [ModChooseAction] commands are expanded. If a [ModChooseAction] is wrapped inside another
 * [ModCommand] (e.g., as part of a composite command), it is not recursively expanded.
 *
 * Note 3: If at any point of the execution there is an exception coming from the [ModCommandAction] being performed,
 * the exception is logged and an empty list is returned.
